About
---
I am currently a **Postdoctoral Research Officer** at the **University of Oxford** (2020 - ), jointly between the ERC Synergy Project "Distributional National Accounts" at the Institute for New Economic Thinking (**Department of Social Policy**) and the Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science (**Department of Sociology**), as well as a Non-Stipendiary Research Fellow of **Nuffield College**.
\
\
Within the Department of Social Policy, I also teach and supervise M.Sc./M.Phil. students of Comparative Social Policy.
\
\
I have a **Ph.D. in Public Policy** from **Bocconi University** (2021), with a thesis on “_Social Stratification, Life Course, and Political Inequality_” (**Chair: F.C. Billari; Committee: C. De Vries, G. Esping-Andersen, R. Macmillan**). Previously, I completed a **M.Sc. in Political Economy of Europe** at the **London School of Economics** (2015) and a **B.Sc. in International Economics** at **Bocconi** University (2014).



**Research Interests and Methods**
\
\
My research interests are at the intersection of **Social Stratification**, **Demography**, and **Democracy**, and more specifically on the interplay between macro-level social dynamics (e.g., unemployment, inequality), individual characteristics (e.g., unemployment experiences, age, social class), and socio-political action, including political participation, socio-political trust, and attitudes towards democracy.
\
\
To pursue these research interests, I combine perspectives from Economic Sociology and the Life Course Approach to study socio-political outcomes.
\
\
I rely on **quantitative methods**, with a focus on exploring the role of context and mechanisms through **multilevel** models, **panel** data analysis, **fixed effects** models, and **counterfactuals** approaches.
\
\
My work has appeared in leading journals such as the _European Sociological Review_, and _Social Science Research_, featured in the European Social Survey Select Findings (https://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/docs/findings/ESS1_9_select_findings.pdf), and has received media attention in outlets including the BBC and RTÉ Ireland.
