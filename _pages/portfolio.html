More At the dawn of research in social sciences, Aristotle of Stagira addressed the dangers that inequalities pose to any community (Politics, 2019 [IVth Century BC]). 
Aristotle considered inequality as potentially deadly for peace, insofar its excessive levels would create “a state of slaves and despots, of people that envy and people that despise” (Politics, V, 1295b). 
Furthermore, Aristotle identified inequality as the prime “origin of rebellions” (Politics, V, 1301b), as affluent groups seek to retain their privileges, while struggling groups may revolt to reduce inequalities. 
Therefore, Aristotle considered economic inequality as particularly dangerous when it sparks conflicts between different social groups, defined by their position in the social hierarchy.
