**Research Motivation**


At the dawn of social science research, **Aristotle of Stagira** argued that **inequality** was the prime “_origin of rebellions_” (Politics 2019, V, 1301b), as its excessive levels would create “_a state of slaves and despots, of people that envy and people that despise_” (Politics, V, 1295b). 
\
\
More than two millennia later, inequality in its **many forms** is a **central** concern for societies and democracies. As a social scientist, my **broader goal** is to explore how inequalities **interact** with the **social, economic, and political domains**. More specifically, I study the interplay between **Social Stratification, Demography, and Democracy**.
\
\
**Social Stratification and Democracy**
\
\
In my first stream of research, I examine how different forms of **social stratification** affects **socio-political outcomes** that are **important for democracy**, such as voter turnout (_European Sociological Review_, 2021), social trust (_Social Science Research_, 2023), social participation (_Participation and Conflict/Partecipazione e Conflitto_, 2022) political efficacy,, party choice, attitudes towards migrants, and more generally attitudes towards democracy.
\
\
I contribute to this stream by highlighting how **emerging forms of stratification**, such as unemployment scarring and precarious work, affect such outcomes, or by studying how **established forms of social stratification** affect increasingly relevant political concepts (origin/destination social class and political efficacy).
\
\
The **common pattern** emerging from this stream is that **socio-economic vulnerability** typically translates into **political marginality**, with **contextual socio-economic dynamics** either _mitigating_ or _exacerbating_ this relationship.

**Social Stratification and Demography**

In a second stream, with Richard Breen and Brian Nolan, we examine how **earnings inequality** is shaped by **socio-demographic patterns** in OECD countries. Relying on novel **decomposition** and **counterfactual approaches** for measures of inequality such as Half the Squared Coefficient of Variation (HSCV/GE(2)) or the Gini Coefficient, we find that the proportion of households led by single women is powerfully associated with higher inequality (**forthcoming** in the _Journal of Economic Inequality_). 
\
\
In a separate paper, we focus more on how **gender inequality in the labour market**: by counterfactually closing gender gaps in employment, hours, and pay in 22 OECD countries, we find out that equalising participation levels would powerfully decrease inequality across most countries, whereas equalising hours and pay is more relevant in countries were participation levels are relatively high.

**Social Stratification, Demography, and Democracy**
\
\
Bringing everything together, I study how **stratification** _interacts_ with **demographic aspects** to affect **democracy**. In a work with Geoffrey Evans, we show that **ideological distance** between the Conservative and Labour parties in the UK depresses turnout overall, and particularly so for citizens in the bottom class and education strata. However, the most affected are **young individuals** in those strata, without a developed turnout habit.
\
\
Following up on the **unemployment-turnout** comparative study (ESR, 2021), I explore how unemployment experiences affect electoral participation with **panel data** in the UK. Building on the impressionable years framework, I show that **unemployment experiences** taking place **before** the age of **35** _strongly depress_ **electoral participation**, while those **after 35** do **not** have a **statistically significant** impact.
\
\
In sum, joining Social Stratification with a Life-Course approaches helps us further illuminate political outcomes.

**The Role of Context and Methods**

During the second year of the Ph.D., Gøsta Esping-Andersen told our cohort: "_As sociologists, always ask yourself: **under what conditions**?_*
\
\
Heeding this advice, my research focuses strongly on the interplay between macro-social dynamics and individual characteristics in shaping outcomes. The works on electoral participation and social trust show that contextual unemployment and individual unemployment may combine counter-intuitively in affecting socio-political outcomes, due to **mechanisms** such as **social stigma** and **differential habituation**. These examples highlight how a broader look at the interaction between social structure and agency.
\
\
**Methodologically**, I match these interests with an expertise in **multilevel** models, typically with cross-level interactions, in **panel** data, instrumental in understanding the role of life-cycle from a quasi-causal perspective, and in **counterfactual** approaches.
